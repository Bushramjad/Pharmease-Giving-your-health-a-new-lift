# Pharmease
Digital Health is the future of healthcare system. “Pharmease” is a system designed primarily for customer and pharmacies. We have seen that a small number of Pharmacies are now online in terms of providing the medicines but it is observed that these systems are not allowing the user/ customer to search the nearby pharmacies or to find which pharmacy have their required medicine. This system is beneficial in terms of locating the nearby pharmacies or searching pharmacies according to the medicines and also in handling the order requests. 

**Objective**
The objective is to design a system to answer all those queries that remain unanswered before, that resulted in loss of time and human effort. Pharmease consist of a mobile Application along with the Web Application for administrative support. It allows the users to find all nearby pharmacies according to their current location, search a specific pharmacy by entering either a medicine or pharmacy name and placing an order directly. If the user places an order he will be notified about the progress of order through push notifications.

Pharmease reduces manual work and work load of users and administration, it saves time which can be used in some other productive way. Today management is one of the most essential features of all form. Management provides an ease to perform any kind of task in a system provided.
